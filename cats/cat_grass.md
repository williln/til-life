## Can I give cat grass to my cat?

Barring any specific reason not to, and if my cat is feeling well, yes, I can give cat grass to my cat. 

## About cat grass 

- Once it's grown a few inches, it **will last 1-3 weeks before wilting**
- **It won't regrow**, so you need to **plant more seeds**
- This is probably why my **cat grass kit came with so many seeds**
- It might help with digestion, might help them pass hairballs, might give them a little fiber.
- It definitely delights my cat. He loves munching on it and gets mad when I take it away.

- In 2023, a cat sitter gave me some cat grass as a gift and my cat loved it. But it died after a few weeks. I was so sad, I was trying to make it "flourish" and stay alive, like a potted plant. But it never recovered. 
- Around the beginning of August 2024, I ordered another [cat grass kit](https://www.chewy.com/smartcat-kittys-garden/dp/49066). It's doing well!
- 8/15/2024: I realize that the leaves are 6 or so inches tall, so I trim them and put the plant in my cat's room. He went nuts! Loved it! But he has a sensitive tummy, so I looked up cat grass to see how much I should let him have.
